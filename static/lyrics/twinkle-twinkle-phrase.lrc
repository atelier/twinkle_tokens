[ti:Twinkle Twinkle Lyric Star]
[offset:3000]
[00:00.000] Twinkle, twinkle, little star, <00:08.307> How I wonder what you are.
[00:12.347] Up above the world so high, <00:16.443> Like a diamond in the sky.
[00:20.531] When the blazing sun is gone, <00:24.588> When he nothing shines upon,
[00:28.659] Then you show your little light, <00:32.707> Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
[00:36.835] Then the traveler in the dark, <00:40.811> Thanks you for your tiny spark,
[00:44.915] He could not see which way to go, <00:48.955> If you did not twinkle so.
[00:53.051] In the dark blue sky you keep, <00:57.091> And often through my curtains peep,
[01:01.155] For you never shut your eye, <01:05.259> Till the sun is in the sky.
